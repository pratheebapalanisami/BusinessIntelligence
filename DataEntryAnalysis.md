## _Data Entry Analysis_

This assignment is to review observations of plankton in three different data files to identify problems/issues and to come up with proper format to collect the data for future.  

### *DataSet Problems*

-	Temperature measurement is not provided with proper unit (‘Celsius’ or ‘Fahrenheit’)
-	Values are missing in few columns like Temp, density and Colony Diameter
-	As the planktons change their distribution during day and night, both measurements are required but the time of the day is not provided.
-	The data has to be captured for the same date in both the zoop-temp and zoop-temp-main file so that it will be easy to compare.
-	In one file Depth is mentioned as Z where as in other two it is mentioned as ‘Depth’. The labeling of the column needs to be constant in all files.
-	There seems to be few negative values in the file which doesn’t make sense
-	Date format is not mentioned (MM/DD/YYYY or DD/MM/YYYY  

### *Solution - New Table Format*
